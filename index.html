                            I'm a problem solver who loves good stories. I
                            discovered the beauty of mathematics in 7th grade
                            through logic games, eventually earning medals at
                            national and international math competitions,

                            curiosity and discipline from math to programming
                            and data analysis, and I'm passionate about turning
                            abstract mathematical ideas into practical,
                            human-centered tools. I believe the problem-solving
                            mindset and analytical skills I've built through
                            mathematics will help me succeed and adapt in the
                            ever-changing world of technology.

                                        I grew up in the northernmost rural part
                                        of Mongolia, where it takes a full day
                                        to reach Ulaanbaatar, the world's
                                        coldest capital. Life there wasn't
                                        extraordinary; people mostly minded
                                        their own business. My parents were no
                                        different. They had never left our town
                                        or gone to college, but they provided me
                                        and my sister with a happy childhood. At
                                        first, this seemed like a limitation,
                                        but I now see it as my greatest
                                        advantage. Because they had never
                                        experienced college or life abroad, they
                                        never hesitated to let me chase every
                                        opportunity I could find.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        That freedom allowed me to study math
                                        for hours without interruption, even
                                        though I was the strongest at home and
                                        could have helped with physically
                                        demanding chores. Eventually, it opened
                                        doors I could never have imagined. I
                                        moved alone to the capital to attend one
                                        of Mongolia's most prestigious high
                                        schools after winning a silver medal at
                                        the national math olympiad, which came
                                        with a full scholarship. This was during
                                        Covid, and living alone at such a young
                                        age was one of the hardest challenges I
                                        had faced. But it also gave me focus. I
                                        pursued my high school dream: to be
                                        selected as one of the six top math
                                        students in the country, represent
                                        Mongolia, and win a medal at the
                                        International Mathematical Olympiad. I
                                        did. I fulfilled my dream, and I was
                                        ready for the next chapter.
                                    </p>

                                        Growing up in a rural town, I had never
                                        realized the importance of English. No
                                        one around me spoke it, except my older
                                        sister in later years. Luckily, the
                                        principal of my high school noticed my
                                        determination and encouraged me to apply
                                        to United World College in Maastricht,
                                        Netherlands. For two years, I lived
                                        among students from around the world,
                                        learning English, embracing new
                                        cultures, and discovering who I could
                                        become. Those years changed me the most.
                                        I went from a boy leaving his country
                                        for the first time to someone confident
                                        in facing any challenge, making friends
                                        across six continents.

                                        and environmental studies to economics,

                                        science and data science. I'm meeting
                                        people from different backgrounds,
                                        learning from them, and shaping the next
                                        chapter of my life. I'm not here because
                                        I was born into wealth or privilege, but
                                        because of supportive parents, inspiring
                                        teachers, and friends I could always
                                        count on.

                                        I like observing my surroundings and
                                        listening to the sounds of life.
                                        Photography is a form of art I enjoy
                                        that helps me remember and store these
                                        moments. Sometimes I simply take out my
                                        phone to capture sudden moments, or go
                                        on a walk with my camera to explore the
                                        beauty around me. I'm always learning
                                        and experimenting, but I've realized I'm
                                        less interested in becoming a
                                        professional and more in following my
                                        feelings, letting my art grow naturally
                                        as I experience the world.

                                        This is how seven-year-old me used to
                                        imagine and commentate on myself while
                                        playing basketball (using socks as a
                                        ball and a chair as a basket) after
                                        watching the 2010 NBA Finals. One
                                        player, Kobe, stood out from the rest
                                        and became the best player in the
                                        finals. That's when I first realized
                                        what a great sport basketball is, seeing
                                        the joy he brought to twenty thousand
                                        fans at Staples Center. Since then, I've
                                        enjoyed everything about basketball:
                                        playing it, watching it, exploring the
                                        stories around it, and even video games
                                        about it.

                                        Video games are my way to relax and take
                                        a break from reality. I often prefer a
                                        good game over a movie or a book,
                                        because they beautifully combine art and
                                        technology. They teach lessons, evoke a
                                        wide range of emotions, and let you
                                        experience things you'd never do in real
                                        life. I find myself arguing with friends
                                        over their choices in a game, focusing
                                        on puzzles , or riding a horse across
                                        the open world of Ancient Egypt. It's a
                                        unique form of storytelling that truly
                                        makes you part of the story.

                                    <h4>On Education & Teaching</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I believe that better education is the
                                        key to creating a better world. I have
                                        studied in a rural public school, a
                                        prestigious private school, an
                                        international boarding school, and now
                                        at a liberal arts college. Each
                                        experience taught me something different
                                        about the power of good education.
                                        Because of these experiences, I believe
                                        education should be accessible to
                                        everyone. It has become a central part
                                        of my dream to build a world-class
                                        educational institution, giving more
                                        children the chance to discover and
                                        pursue their passions and dreams, no
                                        matter where they are born. To take
                                        steps toward that dream, I have been
                                        tutoring high school students in
                                        Mongolia as much as I can, sharing
                                        everything I know and helping them grow.

                                        course, I implemented a simulation of it
                                        in Python. The project will be developed
                                        further.
